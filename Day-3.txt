YAML Coding

YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable data format.

Used in DevOps for writing configuration files (e.g., Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Ansible).

It is simple, structured, and easy to understand.

Example YAML:

version: "3"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"


What, Why, Where – Questions

What → Understand the concept (definition).

Why → Know the purpose (reason/importance).

Where → Identify the place of use (applications).


Scaling in DevOps

Horizontal Scaling → Adding more machines/instances to handle the load (e.g., adding more servers).

Vertical Scaling → Increasing the power of a single machine (e.g., adding more CPU/RAM).
