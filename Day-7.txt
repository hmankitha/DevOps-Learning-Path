Day 7: Jenkins Scripted Pipelines
✅ Topics Covered

What is a Scripted Pipeline?
Written in Groovy.
Uses node {} blocks for execution.
Provides flexibility and complex logic handling.
More control than Declarative pipelines.

📝 Scripted Pipeline Example
node {
    stage('Checkout') {
        checkout scm
    }
    stage('Build') {
        echo "Compiling source code..."
        sh 'mvn clean install'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        echo "Running unit tests..."
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        echo "Deploying to server..."
        sh 'scp target/app.war user@server:/apps/'
    }
}

🔑 Key Points

Declarative vs Scripted:

Declarative → Easier, structured, preferred for beginners.
Scripted → Advanced, supports full Groovy code.
Supports loops, conditionals, try-catch, and shared libraries.
Often used for complex CI/CD workflows where fine-grained control is needed.
